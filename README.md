Stack Overflow temporal network

In this network we have answer interactions with the timestamps which have been taken place in Stack Overflow website.   
So the purpose is to analyse the network using different tools and methods.   
[Here](https://github.com/Masoudvahid/complex_networks_project/blob/main/Stack%20Overflow%20temporal%20network.pptx) is the presentation for this network   
and [Here](https://github.com/Masoudvahid/complex_networks_project/blob/main/reaseach.ipynb) you can find the codes used in this project.
